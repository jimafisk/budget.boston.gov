            "The City&rsquo;s projected revenues provide the basis for planning FY18 appropriations to maintain a balanced budget. Selected FY18 budgeted City revenues compare with FY17 budgeted revenues as follows: the net property tax levy increases $113.7 million or 5.6%; excises increase $3.8 million or 2.0%; miscellaneous department revenues increase by $9.7 million or 17.4%; licenses and permits increase by $2.1 million or 3.4%, and state aid increases by $10.7 million or 2.5%.",
            "On the expenditure side of the budget, total appropriations increase by $96.7 million or 4.1% and fixed costs increase by $51.7 million or 8.3%. Selected FY18 budgeted appropriations compare with FY17 budgeted appropriations as follows: City Appropriations increase $32.0 million or 2.7%; the Boston Public Health Commission increases by $1.8 million or 2.3%; and the School Department increases $29.2 million or 2.8%. In addition, collective bargaining reserves are set aside for the School Department at $20 million and City Departments at $27 million; when collective bargaining agreements are negotiated, these reserves will be used to cover those increased costs. Within City Appropriations, actual City Departments are increasing by $25.6 million or 2.7% over FY17. These departmental increases are low relative to other years due to the expiration of nearly all collective bargaining agreements, 11 central appropriations, including a large appropriation for Health Insurance totaling $216.9 million which is increasing by $10.6 million or 5.2% and is also included within City Appropriations.",
            "FY18 budgeted fixed costs are increasing by $51.7 million and compare with FY17 budgeted fixed costs as follows: Pensions increase $21.9 million or 11%; Debt Service increases $9.6 million or 5.5%; Charter School Tuition state assessment increases $17.5 million or 11.2%; MBTA state assessment increases by $2 million or 2.4%; and other state assessments increases $44 thousand or 8.5%."

            "Municipal health care reform legislation, passed by the State legislature in 2011 provided municipalities more freedom in health plan design, and also mandated that all Medicare-eligible municipal retirees enroll in Medicare Part B and a City sponsored Medicare supplement plan. As a direct result of mandated Medicare enrollment, approximately 5,500 additional City retirees and their spouses have enrolled in Medicare supplement plans. Benefits for these plans are comparable to non-Medicare plans but costs are lower due to Medicare reimbursements. Over 70% of retirees and spouses are now enrolled in Medicare plans, compared to just 37% prior to the legislation. City savings from this mandate, beginning in FY13, have totaled approximately $20 million annually &ndash; a major contributor to the total cost decrease in FY13. ",
            "City retirees and their beneficiaries are eligible for Medicare through payment of Medicare payroll taxes during their working career. Medicare taxes are paid for all City employees who were hired after March 1986. The City&rsquo;s share of 50% Medicare taxes, totaling $19.3 million in the FY18 budget, has increased an average 12% annually since FY01. This growth is due to increases in total payroll and also the increasing percentage of total employees who were hired after March 1986 and are impacted by the tax. Because more Medicare eligible employees are now retiring, the percentage of all retirees enrolling into Medicare plans will continue to increase.",

The City, including the Boston Public Health Commission (BPHC), has an unfunded liability for these benefits of $2.26 billion, as of the most recent independent actuarial valuation on June 30, 2015.

Annual allocations are retained in an irrevocable Trust Fund, authorized through the City&rsquo;s acceptance of M.G.L. Chapter 32B section 20. As of December 31, 2016 the Fund had a balance of $437 million. ",

",
            "Through Boston&rsquo;s Way Home and the Boston Homes for the Brave initiative, Boston has housed 842 homeless veterans since July 2014. Because of its commitment to ongoing investments in housing and services, Boston maintains the lowest rate of unsheltered people experiencing homelessness among all major US cities, and the lowest rate of unsheltered homelessness among individuals with chronic patterns of homelessness.",
            "To support Boston&rsquo;s Way Home, the FY18 budget includes an increase of $150,000 in federal funds to provide support services for veterans not eligible for VA programs. In addition, $50,000 in federal funds will be used to modify the Homebuyer Financial Assistance Program to provide down payment assistance to veterans who may not be eligible for the City&rsquo;s programs under current rules.",
            "In FY18, $75,000 will be invested in the Office of Housing Stability to enhance initiatives, including offering training for both landlords and tenants, developing a tenant orientation guide, and funding families in need of emergency placement. Since July 2014 a total of 2,521 households have been able to retain their housing as a result of City services such as foreclosure and eviction prevention.",
            "The FY18 budget continues Boston&rsquo;s annual $7.25 million general fund investment in housing. This amount includes a line item used exclusively for elderly housing production. The elderly housing investment was first introduced by Mayor Walsh in FY16. Combining these general fund dollars with federal grants, state grants, and developer fees allows the City to leverage a wide variety of sources to invest in the creation and preservation of affordable housing citywide, a key to reaching targets outlined in Mayor Walsh&rsquo;s Housing a Changing City: Boston 2030.",
            "To solve the challenges of creating middle income housing in Boston, Mayor Walsh created the Housing Innovation Lab in 2015. The lab&rsquo;s work has led to the adoption of Boston&rsquo;s first density bonus program, which will yield hundreds of privately financed affordable housing units; the launch of a compact living development competition on City-owned vacant land; and support for an accessory dwelling units policy. As grant funding for this program is exhausted, the City will invest $97,500 in general funds to maintain the operation in FY18. ",
            "The FY18 Budget projects that DND will receive over $62 million in external funds from federal and state grants, as well as revenue from certain developer fees. Although proposed federal budget cuts raises questions about future levels of funding for Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) and HOME Investment Partnership, this budget assumes that DND will continue to receive these recurring federal entitlement grants, which provide funding for a variety of neighborhood development activities as well as competitive grants such as the Continuum of Care (CoC) program. The City will advocate that these critical programs are maintained in the federal budget. Additionally, the City uses the funding from the Inclusionary Development Fund to support the creation of affordable housing citywide."

The FY18 operating budget also invests in five new fire apparatus, complemented by an additional eight on the capital plan, as part of the fire apparatus replacement plan launched in FY17. Also reflected is the Mayor&rsquo;s priority of firefighter health and safety: additional funds for sharps disposal boxes are included as well as $500,000 for a pilot program to provide industrial cleaning to firehouses to eliminate potentially carcinogenic compounds. Similar to the Police Department, the Fire Department budget continues to aggressively manage their overtime, for a projected $2.5 million in costs avoided in FY18.
